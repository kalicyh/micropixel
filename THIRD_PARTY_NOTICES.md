## ESP-IoT-Solution

`firmware/espressif/components/esp-iot-solution/` is a Git submodule of the MicroPixel fork of Espressif's
esp-iot-solution; the build only uses its `esp_lvgl_adapter` component through `override_path`:

- fork: <https://github.com/78/esp-iot-solution>;
- branch: `codex/lvgl-monotonic-tick`;
- pinned commit: `bdff5cab67300f7fe705ed47af2c4c0ace840a2c`;
- upstream: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution>;
- copyright: Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD;
- license: Apache-2.0.

## LLVM libc++ in Guest applications

MicroPixel Guest applications are compiled with libc++ headers and selected static-library objects distributed by
wasi-sdk. Link-time garbage collection retains only objects referenced by each Guest:

- upstream: <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libcxx>;
- toolchain distribution: <https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk>;
- license: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception.

The toolchain distributions contain the complete applicable license and attribution files. MicroPixel does not
copy the libc++ source tree into this repository.

## MetalioClaw4 board initialization and display driver

The TCA9555 startup pin directions and peripheral rail levels in
`firmware/espressif/main/platform/boards/metalio-claw4/board_io.cpp` follow
`IOExpander.hpp` and `metalio-claw-4.cc` from MetalioClaw4 revision
`ca3aa3fa027ff7dad2adf0c2d03c4f24aa838950`. MicroPixel writes output latches
before enabling output directions and retains its own peripheral lifecycle.
The source project and MIT notice below apply.

Portions of `firmware/espressif/main/platform/drivers/display/nv3051f/esp_lcd_nv3051f.c` and
`firmware/espressif/main/platform/drivers/display/nv3051f/esp_lcd_nv3051f.h`, including the panel initialization sequence, are derived
from the MetalioClaw4 project:

- upstream: <https://github.com/CloudZao/MetalioClaw4>;
- referenced revision: `5a9841fd2cbd`;
- license: MIT.

## ESP-IDF managed components

ESP-IDF, LVGL, and components resolved from the Espressif Component Registry are build dependencies and are not
vendored in this repository. Version constraints are declared in `firmware/espressif/main/idf_component.yml`;
ESP-IDF-generated target lock files are local build outputs and are not version-controlled. Each component's own
license terms apply when it is downloaded or redistributed in a binary release.

## Espressif flasher stub

The browser firmware installer loads the ESP32-S31 RAM flasher binary from the `esp-flasher-stub` npm package:

- upstream: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-flasher-stub>;
- package/version: `esp-flasher-stub` 1.2.2;
- license: Apache-2.0 OR MIT.

The package retains the complete Apache-2.0 and MIT license texts. MicroPixel uses the unmodified ESP32-S31 JSON
artifact and implements only the Web Serial upload and protocol integration around it.

## Bosch SensorAPI

`firmware/espressif/components/bosch_sensorapi/` contains the minimal unmodified C sources and headers used for
ESP-Mosaico's BMI270 inertial sensor and two BMM150 magnetometers:

- BMI270 SensorAPI: <https://github.com/boschsensortec/BMI270_SensorAPI>, pinned commit
  `41129fcfe39c583ee5462d79195741945d51c1fe`;
- BMM150 SensorAPI: <https://github.com/boschsensortec/BMM150_SensorAPI>, pinned commit
  `0dce0617873cda1f6d51f6b7b961fdc2641e0c7c`;
- copyright: Bosch Sensortec GmbH;
- license: BSD-3-Clause.

The complete upstream license text is retained alongside each copied driver. MicroPixel supplies only the
ESP-IDF transport callbacks and board-level scheduling wrappers.

### esp_codec_dev

ESP-Mosaico and ESP32-S3 ES8311/AW88298 initialization use `espressif/esp_codec_dev` 1.6.2 from the ESP Component Registry:

- upstream: <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_codec_dev>, Apache-2.0;
- scope: ES8311 codec configuration and the ESP-IDF I2S data interface; MicroPixel supplies the shared-I2C-executor
  control interface and keeps Host master-volume attenuation in its fixed-capacity audio backend.

The declared version constraint is recorded in `firmware/espressif/main/idf_component.yml`, and the downloaded
component retains its complete license file.

### spi_nand_flash and dhara

The ESP-Mosaico App Store medium (external 128 MiB SPI NAND) is driven through `espressif/spi_nand_flash` from the
ESP Component Registry, which vendors the dhara flash translation layer via `espressif/dhara`:

- upstream: <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/spi_nand_flash>, Apache-2.0;
- dhara: <https://github.com/dlbeer/dhara>, ISC-style permissive licence, redistributed inside the component;
- scope: chip detection, SPI command sequencing, wear-leveling and logical-sector journaling; MicroPixel supplies the
  `device::BlockStorage` adapter (`platform/storage/spi_nand_block_storage.cpp`) and keeps BundleFS's copy-on-write
  transaction and recovery model above it. The dependency is declared only for the `esp32s31` target.

### ESP-BOX-3 board definitions

The native ESP32-S3-BOX-3 backend derives its pin assignments, controller selection and vendor display initialization
sequence from Espressif's `esp-box-3` BSP 3.2.0:

- upstream: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/esp-box-3>, Apache-2.0;
- scope: only the board-specific I2C, display, touch and backlight facts needed by MicroPixel are maintained locally;
  the upstream BSP component is not linked, so it does not constrain the shared codec or LVGL dependency versions.

### M5Stack CoreS3 board definitions

The M5Stack CoreS3 backend derives its pin assignments, controller selection and power sequencing from Espressif's
`m5stack_core_s3` BSP:

- upstream: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/bsp/m5stack_core_s3>, Apache-2.0;
- scope: board-specific I2C, display, touch, AW88298 audio and AXP2101/AW9523 power-control facts are maintained
  locally; the upstream BSP component is not linked.

### micro-opus and libopus

Ogg Opus playback uses `esphome/micro-opus` 0.4.1 from the ESP Component Registry:

- wrapper and Ogg demuxer: <https://github.com/esphome-libs/micro-opus>, Apache-2.0;
- bundled Xiph.Org libopus: <https://github.com/xiph/opus>, BSD 3-Clause;
- resolved component source revision: `8354085908683c6130e32a832aeec8a7ca115c51`.

The downloaded managed component contains the complete Apache-2.0 notice and the upstream libopus copyright and
license files. MicroPixel uses its streaming Ogg Opus decoder with one shared PSRAM-backed pseudostack and does not
expose the component API to Guest applications.

### esp_tinyusb and TinyUSB

ESP-Mosaico Type-C CDC uses `espressif/esp_tinyusb` 2.2.1 and its `espressif/tinyusb` dependency from the ESP
Component Registry:

- Espressif integration: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb/tree/master/device/esp_tinyusb>, Apache-2.0;
- TinyUSB upstream: <https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb>, MIT.

The declared version constraints are recorded in `firmware/espressif/main/idf_component.yml`, and the downloaded
components retain their complete license files.

### NT26 UART transport dependencies

The ESP32-P4 build uses these Apache-2.0 components from the ESP Component Registry:

- `78/uart-uhci` 0.4.0: <https://github.com/78/uart-uhci>;
- `78/uart-eth-modem` 0.7.0: <https://github.com/78/uart-eth-modem>;
- `espressif/iot_eth` 1.1.0: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/tree/master/components/iot_eth>.

Exact versions are recorded in `firmware/espressif/main/idf_component.yml`. The UHCI package declares
Apache-2.0 in its manifest; the modem and iot_eth packages also include their upstream license texts.
MicroPixel does not maintain a copied NT26 or UHCI implementation.

## System font sources

Built-in English text, icon generation, and Host font tests use font files vendored in
`firmware/espressif/main/platform/lvgl/fonts/vendor/` so release builds do not depend on LVGL
component-archive extras:

- Montserrat Medium: SIL Open Font License 1.1; copyright 2011 The Montserrat Project Authors;
  license text in `LICENSE.Montserrat.txt`.
- DejaVu Sans: Bitstream Vera license with DejaVu changes in the public domain; license text in
  `LICENSE.DejaVuSans.txt`.
- Font Awesome 5 Free: SIL Open Font License 1.1 for the font; icons CC BY 4.0; copyright 2022
  Fonticons, Inc.; license text in `LICENSE.FontAwesome5.txt`.

MicroPixel's generated `builtin-latin-v1` semantic fonts include the public SDK symbol set from Font
Awesome 5. The Hall's Wi-Fi and cellular signal icons use fixed-size alpha masks derived from its
Wi-Fi and signal glyphs. Strength variants preserve each source glyph's baseline and footprint.

The alpha masks are generated by `tools/generate_wifi_status_icons.py` and `tools/generate_cellular_status_icons.py`.
Cellular masks are generated into the build directory.

## Windows AOT compiler build dependencies

The Windows verification workflow builds pinned LLVM sources (upstream LLVM for RISC-V and
Espressif's LLVM fork for Xtensa). Exact revisions are recorded in
[the toolchain source lock](tools/windows/toolchain-sources.json). LLVM is licensed under
Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception; the compiler artifact carries both LLVM and WAMR license texts.
WASI SDK is downloaded from its official release and verified against the locked SHA-256.
No third-party compiler source or binary is committed into this repository.

## Windows SDK embedded runtime

Windows SDK manager distributions bundle CPython 3.13.12 (Python Software Foundation
License Version 2 and the bundled third-party license notices) and pyserial 3.5
(BSD-3-Clause). Exact upstream archives and SHA-256 values are locked in
`tools/windows/runtime-sources.json`. Runtime archives must retain Python's
`LICENSE.txt` and pyserial's source license. Inno Setup is the build-time
installer compiler; its license does not replace the bundled components' licenses.

Windows WASI compiler deployment also includes app-local Microsoft Visual C++
Runtime 2015–2022 files, version 14.44.35211.0, from the Visual Studio 2022
redistributable directory. File hashes are pinned in `tools/windows/msvc-crt-sources.json`.
These proprietary Microsoft components are covered by the
[Microsoft runtime license](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/license-terms/vs2022-cruntime/)
and [distributable list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/redistribution),
not MicroPixel's Apache-2.0 license. The package retains a dedicated Microsoft notice.
MicroPixel updates must also deliver updates to this app-local runtime.

## System language fonts

Downloaded system language packs are subsets of Noto Sans, Noto Sans SC/TC/JP/KR, licensed under the
SIL Open Font License 1.1. Copyright and complete license texts are retained in
[`tools/fonts/licenses/NotoSans-OFL.txt`](tools/fonts/licenses/NotoSans-OFL.txt) and
[`tools/fonts/licenses/NotoCJK-OFL.txt`](tools/fonts/licenses/NotoCJK-OFL.txt), and distributed alongside the fonts.
Sources: [Noto CJK](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk) and [Noto Sans](https://github.com/notofonts/latin-greek-cyrillic).
The subset generator reads the pinned [DeepSeek-V4-Flash tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash)
(MIT) to extract Unicode character sets. Model weights and tokenizer files are not included in firmware.

The bounded CJK rasterizer includes the existing LVGL dependency's `stb_truetype_htcw.h` implementation
under its upstream MIT/public-domain license; no copy of the third-party implementation is maintained here.

## ESP-1Wire read-only iButton protocol

`firmware/espressif/main/platform/onewire/` adapts the read protocol from
[ESP-1Wire](https://github.com/kalicyh/esp-1wire), `DS1977_1991/components/onewire/`,
revision `d3e66d5e249a4699ab17de671eec5c4f21959c58`.
